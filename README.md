Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
========================================================

Purpose 
-----------------

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 

1. a tidy data set as described below;
2. a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis; and 
3. a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called ``CodeBook.md``. 

You should also include a ``README.md`` in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.  

Objectives
-----------------

`run_analysis.R` performs the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

run_analysis.R
-----------------

The script `run_analysis.R`performs the 5 steps described in the course project's definition.

* First, all the similar data is merged using the `rbind()` function. By similar, we address those files having the same number of columns and referring to the same entities.
* Then, only those columns with the mean and standard deviation measures are taken from the whole dataset. After extracting these columns, they are given the correct names, taken from `features.txt`.
* As activity data is addressed with values 1:6, we take the activity names and IDs from `activity_labels.txt` and they are substituted in the dataset.
* On the whole dataset, those columns with vague column names are corrected.
* Finally, we generate a new dataset with all the average measures for each subject and activity type (30 subjects * 6 activities = 180 rows). The output file is called `averages_data.txt`, and uploaded to this repository.
