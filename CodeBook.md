Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
==========================================

This repository holds the R code, documentation and output files for the coursera course "Getting and Cleaning data".
The dataset being used is: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Files

The code takes for granted all the data is downloaded and present in the working directory that is set by the script, the data is un-compressed and without names altered.

`CodeBook.md` describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

`run_analysis.R` contains all the code to perform the analyses outlined for completion in the "Getting and Cleaning Data" project. 

The output of the run_analysis.R is called `averages_data.txt`, and is uploaded in the course project's form into the repo.

# Variables

* `x_train`, `y_train`, `x_test`, `y_test`, `subject_train` and `subject_test` contain the data from the downloaded files.
* `x_data`, `y_data` and `subject_data` merge the previous datasets to further analysis.
* `features` contains the correct names for the `x_data` dataset, which are applied to the column names stored in `mean_and_std_features`, a numeric vector used to extract the desired data.
* A similar approach is taken with activity names through the `activities` variable.
* `all_data` merges `x_data`, `y_data` and `subject_data` in a big dataset.
* Finally, `averages_data` contains the relevant averages which will be later stored in a `.txt` file. `ddply()` from the plyr package is used to apply `colMeans()` and ease the development.
